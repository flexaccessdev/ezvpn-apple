/*
 * ezvpn.h — C interface to libezvpn.a for the iOS Network Extension.
 *
 * Build the static library with ./build-ios.sh (produces
 * dist/ios/libezvpn.a alongside a copy of this header).
 *
 * Lifecycle (call from your NEPacketTunnelProvider):
 *
 *   1. ezvpn_connect(configJson, buf, len)  -> handle (or NULL on error)
 *        On success `buf` holds the network-config JSON; use it to build
 *        NEPacketTunnelNetworkSettings, then setTunnelNetworkSettings.
 *        On error `buf` holds the error message.
 *   2. ezvpn_run(handle, utunFd)            -> 0 on success, -1 on error
 *        Pass the utun file descriptor obtained after the settings apply.
 *   3. ezvpn_stop(handle)                   (in stopTunnel / on teardown)
 *
 * All functions are NULL-safe and never unwind into Swift.

 *   routes/routes6 are the split-tunnel prefixes; they are used to compute which
 *   server underlay addresses overlap and must be excluded from the tunnel.
 * out_buf/out_len : caller buffer. On success receives the network-config JSON
 *   (per-family fields are null when that family was not assigned):
 *   {"assigned_ip":"10.0.0.2","netmask":"255.255.255.0","gateway":"10.0.0.1",

 *    "excluded_routes":["192.168.1.5/32"],"excluded_routes6":[]}
 *   On failure receives an error message. Always NUL-terminated.
 *   If out_buf is too small to hold the full network-config JSON, this is
 *   treated as a failure (returns NULL, no handle leaked) — retry with a larger
 *   buffer. (Error messages may still be truncated to fit.)
 *
 * Returns a non-NULL handle on success, NULL on failure.
