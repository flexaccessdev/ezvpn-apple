# ezvpn-ios (POC)

A minimal iOS app + Packet Tunnel extension that runs the [`ezvpn`](../ezvpn)
IP-over-QUIC tunnel on-device. **POC scope:** dual-stack **split tunnel**,
real-device testing only, no App Store preparation.

It links `libezvpn.xcframework` (the Rust core, built from the sibling `../ezvpn`
repo and delivered via a local Swift package) into a `NEPacketTunnelProvider`.
The Rust side does the iroh connect + handshake + datagram loop; iOS owns the
`utun` interface, routing, and IP/MTU config.

## What this POC does and does not do

- ✅ Multiple saved VPN profiles, WireGuard-app style: a tunnel list where each
  profile is its own `NETunnelProviderManager` (name shown in Settings > VPN).
  Add/edit/rename/delete profiles; connect one at a time (activating a second
  automatically tears down the first). All profiles share the one PacketTunnel
  extension — each carries its own config in `providerConfiguration`.
- ✅ IPv4/IPv6 split tunnel. The tunnel's own subnet (from the server-assigned
  address + mask) is always routed automatically; extra CIDRs are optional.
- ✅ Connects to an `ezvpn` server over iroh (direct or relay), handshakes,
  tunnels IP over QUIC datagrams.
- ✅ Underlay-bypass routing, like the desktop client's bootstrap bypass: at
  connect, the core computes every relay IP plus the server's candidate
  underlay addresses, and any of them a routed prefix would capture is excluded
  from the tunnel (`excludedRoutes`), so the transport never self-captures.
  Static (handshake-time) only — the server's mid-session address publications
  are not re-applied.
- ✅ Simple manual connect/disconnect. Tunnel teardown follows wireguard-apple:
  `stopTunnel` completes only after the Rust data plane has actually stopped.
- ✅ Disconnect on network change: any change to the physical network (Wi-Fi ↔
  cellular, different Wi-Fi, network lost) cancels the tunnel rather than trying
  to migrate the QUIC session across it — reconnect manually on the new network.
- ✅ Refuses to start when a configured split-tunnel route overlaps the local
  network's subnet (e.g. routing `192.168.0.0/16` while on a `192.168.1.0/24`
  Wi-Fi): capturing the on-link subnet would cut off the LAN, including the
  gateway carrying the tunnel's own underlay traffic.
- ✅ Debug: while connected, the app shows the *applied* interface state —
  assigned addresses, tunnel routes, and the active bypass (excluded) routes —
  queried live from the tunnel process over the WireGuard-style
  runtime-configuration app message (single byte `0`).
- ❌ No App Store / TestFlight setup. No simulator (a Packet Tunnel Provider
  only runs on a real device).
  
## Prerequisites

- **Paid Apple Developer account.** The Network Extension (`packet-tunnel-provider`)
  capability is not available on free personal teams. Both the app and the
  extension App IDs need the *Network Extensions* capability enabled (Xcode's
  automatic signing will offer to add it, or enable it in the Developer portal).
- Xcode (tested with 26.2) on Apple Silicon.
- [`xcodegen`](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen): `brew install xcodegen`.
- Rust with the iOS target (only for local FFI dev): `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios`.

## Build & run

The Rust core is delivered as `libezvpn.xcframework` via a local Swift package
(`Packages/Ezvpn`). Its binary target **downloads the pinned release zip by
URL+checksum** by default — no local Rust build required. Bump to a newer
`ezvpn` release with `scripts/bump-xcframework.sh <tag>` (rewrites the URL and
checksum in `Packages/Ezvpn/Package.swift`).

1. **Generate the Xcode project** (SPM fetches the pinned xcframework):

   ```sh
   cd ../ezvpn-ios
   xcodegen generate
   open Ezvpn.xcodeproj
   ```

   > **Local FFI dev** — to build against a locally compiled Rust core instead
   > of the release, build it in the sibling repo and set `EZVPN_LOCAL_XCFRAMEWORK`:
   >
   > ```sh
   > cd ../ezvpn && ./build-ios.sh release && cd ../ezvpn-ios
   > EZVPN_LOCAL_XCFRAMEWORK=1 xcodegen generate
   > # …and pass the same env var to xcodebuild / Xcode when building.
   > ```
   >
   > SPM forbids binary paths outside the package root, so the sibling's
   > `dist/ios` is reached via the committed symlink
   > `Packages/Ezvpn/local/libezvpn.xcframework`.

3. **Set signing.** Select your Team on **both** targets (`EzvpnApp` and
   `PacketTunnel`) under *Signing & Capabilities*. You can also set
   `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in `project.yml` and re-run `xcodegen generate`.

   If you change the bundle identifiers, update `providerBundleID` in
   `Sources/EzvpnApp/VPNController.swift` to match the extension's id (it must
   be a prefix-child of the app id, e.g. `com.you.ezvpn` + `.PacketTunnel`).

4. **Run on a real device** (select your iPhone, not a simulator). On first
   connect, iOS prompts to allow the VPN configuration.

5. **Add a profile** (tap `+`), fill in the details, Save, then toggle it on:
   - *Name* — a unique label for the profile (shown in the list and Settings > VPN).
   - *Server node id* — the `ezvpn` server's iroh endpoint id.
   - *Auth token* — required; the token the server authenticates you with.
   - *Relay URLs* — optional hints; leave blank to use iroh defaults.
   - *Routes* — the private CIDRs to tunnel (defaults to RFC1918).

   Add as many profiles as you like; only one connects at a time.

   Run a reachable `ezvpn` server (see the `ezvpn` repo) configured with an
   IPv4 `network` and routes covering the private resources you want to reach.

### Unit tests

The pure IP/CIDR logic (prefix overlap, netmask math, the split-tunnel vs
local-network conflict check) lives in the local package `Packages/TunnelCore`
so it can be tested natively on the Mac — the app targets are device-only and
can't host a test bundle:

```sh
cd Packages/TunnelCore && swift test
```

## How it fits together

```
┌─────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────────┐

                                    └──────────────────────────────┘
```

The C boundary is `ezvpn.h` (three calls: `ezvpn_connect` → `ezvpn_run` →
`ezvpn_stop`), delivered inside the xcframework. See the header for the JSON
config/result shapes.

## Logs

The extension logs to the unified log (subsystem
`com.example.ezvpn.PacketTunnel`). Watch with:

```sh
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.example.ezvpn.PacketTunnel"' --level debug
```

Rust-side logs go to stderr (honors `RUST_LOG`, default `info`) and are captured
into the device log as well.

## Notes

- One benign linker warning (`blake3_neon.o was built for newer iOS version`)
  comes from a dependency's hand-written assembly object; it links and runs
  fine.
- Regenerate the project (`xcodegen generate`) after editing `project.yml`. The
  `.xcodeproj` is git-ignored on purpose.
